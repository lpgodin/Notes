```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- c(0, 6, 4787)
barplot(dat, 
        main="A1 Q3 Order of Growth, Empirically", 
        xlab="Function Type",
        ylab="Time of Execution (ms)",
        names.arg = c("Linear\n(0 ms)", "Quadratic\n (6 ms)", "Cubic\n(4787 ms)")

)
```

`Each function was given an N value of 2500. Linear and Quadratic methods run extremely fast, under 10 ms. The Cubic method runs much slower, at almost 5 seconds. `
