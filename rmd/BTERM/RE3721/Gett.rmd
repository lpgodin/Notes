# Observations While Watching

* obsession with purity/ chastity

* Judges actively talk down to women to a much further extent than to any of the men in the court room

* Even Carmel often talks down to Viviane

* Interesting when Viviane says that in the US has a much better situation for divorce
  * not all things are fixed in Us

* Judges were actively racist towards the Rabbi of color

* Elisha didn't even know Viviane smoked cigarettes

* The hair??
