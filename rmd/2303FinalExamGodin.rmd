	typedef enum {
		waitingForBot,
		inLine,
		withRobot,
		exiting
	} State;

	State updateStudent(State currentState, Event event) {
		switch(event) {
			case robotAtEntrance():
				currentState = withRobot;
				break;
			case firstInLine():
				currentState = waitingForBot;
				break;
			case exitNext():
				currentState = exiting;
				break;
			default:
				break;
	}

A datatype of an Array filled with character pointers would be the best option for this application.
