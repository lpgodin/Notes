# RBE 2001 Notes 9-16

# Motor Drive

* A microprocessor cannot drive a motor directly, because it cannot supply enough voltage or current
* As a result, there must be some interfacing circuitry:
  * Motor power is supplied from some other power source
  * Control signals are supplied by the microprocessor
* A variety of technologies exist: such as relays, bipolar transistors, power MOSFETs, and motor drive integrated circuits
* Regardless of the technology used, the basic topology of the interface circuitry is usually the same
* This circuitry is known as an H-bridge

## Bertozzi Looks Annoyed

# The H-Bridge Circuit

# Going Over Motor Controllers
* Pretty straightforward, sending HIGH signal to pins changes parameters for motors

# The Rest Has Been Physics
