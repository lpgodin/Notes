# Liam Godin Lab 1 Exercise
# 1. Generate a sequence of integers: 1,3,5, ... 99
seq(from = 1, to = 99, by = 2)

# 2. Randomly sample 5 values from a sequence of integers from 1 to 10
sample(seq(from = 1, to = 10), size = 5)

# 3. Randomly sample three values from 1 to 10, five values from 11 to 30, and four values from 31 to 50
sample(seq(from = 1 , to = 10), size = 3)
sample(seq(from = 11, to = 30), size = 5)
sample(seq(from = 31, to = 50), size = 4)
