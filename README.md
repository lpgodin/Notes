[**Finished A Term Notes**](https://github.com/lpgodin/Notes/tree/main/finished/ATERM)<br>

[**Current B Term Notes**](https://github.com/lpgodin/Notes/tree/main/finished/BTERM)<br>


## What this is

I use Neovim and rmarkdown in order to write my notes, and then I use a simple script in order to knit the files to pdf documents that I can use as note documents for my classes.
